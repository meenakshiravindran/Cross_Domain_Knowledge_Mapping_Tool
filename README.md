# Cross_Domain_Knowledge_Mapping_Tool
*A Project in AI & NLP Domain*

---

## 🚀 **Overview**

The **Cross Domain Knowledge Mapping Tool** is an AI-powered system that analyzes documents, extracts key concepts, and maps meaningful relationships between them across multiple knowledge domains.
It helps users quickly understand how ideas from one field relate to another — bridging gaps in multidisciplinary research.

This project was developed as part of the **Infosys AI & NLP Internship**.

## 🧠 **Key Features**

* **Automated Text Processing**
  Tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

* **Feature Extraction**
  TF-IDF vectorization and word embeddings to represent concepts numerically.

* **Knowledge Mapping**
  Identifying connections between concepts across different domains.

* **Concept Similarity Analysis**
  Uses vector similarity measures to compute relationships.

* **Interactive Visualization Dashboard**
  Explore cross-domain mappings in an intuitive visual format.

## 📌 **Project Workflow**

### **1️⃣ Data Collection**

* Upload or collect documents (PDFs, research papers, articles).
* Choose a base domain (e.g., *AI in Agriculture*, *AI in Medicine*, etc.).

### **2️⃣ Text Processing**

* Text cleaning & normalization
* Tokenization
* Stopword removal
* Stemming / Lemmatization

### **3️⃣ Feature Extraction**

* TF-IDF Vectorizer
* Word Embeddings (Word2Vec / GloVe)
* Generated feature vectors for each concept.

### **4️⃣ Knowledge Mapping & Visualization**

* Identify concept similarities across domains.
* Generate mappings using cosine similarity.
* Visualize using an interactive dashboard.
